Batch commands: dev/sms/executable/querytest.sh
Result: dev/sms/executable/resultlog/*.txt
(2) Build file for batch testing + logging results

DONE:
(1) Test of two query methods with different benchmark queries.
(2) Pass the correctness test of several representative test cases. Get consistent results.

TODO
(1) Synthetic query generator (control selectivity) t
(2) Query test: big amount of data (collecting experimental results (time+ space)
(3) Clean codes + write down the algorithm in a more formal way

(4) Test use Margaret's data 

(5) Partial materializatiton
(6) Naive query method (IR keyword, Triple store)
