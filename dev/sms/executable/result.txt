#with record
query batch command: executable/query_syn.sh
query files: oboedb/
log: executable/resultlog/2010_0615_log

selectivity	RawDB	MDB
0.01	0.328	5.744
0.05	0.309	5.697
0.1		0.278	5.452
0.2		0.250	5.148
0.5		0.167	4.136

Explanation: 
The result for the trend is strange.
It should be when the selectivity is bigger, the execution time is smaller. 
I need to check what's the problem.
