selectivity	RawDB	MDB
0.01	0.101	0.838
0.05	0.84	1.553

0.5		0.167	4.150

#Explanation: 
#The selectivity in the query file for 2010_0615 test is totally opposite to the intention.
#Now, 
#good results: (1) the time trend with the selectivity works well.
#bad results: (1) MDB still takes too much time
#confusing parts: for RawDB, the trend of 0.05 and 0.1 is not pretty good. 
#I guess this is because my selectivity calculation is just based on one data file, 
#I need to calculate this selectivity based on all the files contain m5 measurements  

#(1) materialization
#(2) Change value selectivity for simple query (compare the several methods)
#(3) Change value selectivity, change output format (did/record_id), simple condition
#(4) Fix value selectivity, change measurement selectivity, simple condition
#(6) Fix value/measurement selectivity, add aggregation
#(7) Fix value/measurement selectivity, change length of context chain
