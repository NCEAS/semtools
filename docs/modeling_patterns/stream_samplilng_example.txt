annotation: mobrien.50 (KNB: knb-lter-sbc.6)

This is the annotation that Ben mentioned in the notes to the call from Mon Jan 24.
It should be updated to be more like the one labeled ocean_rosette_sampling.

Description: each row in the data table will represent a group of measurements on 
a parcel of water in the stream at the same time and place. Protocols differ, 
and some sample-collection protocols are shared (e.g., all nutrients come from the 
same bottle, all chn analyzer samples come from the same filter). It may be useful 
to capture those groupings at some level (eg, for QC). These groupings would probably 
not be used to aggregate values for analysis.  
electronic measurements: by dipping an instrument in the water. 
discrete measurements: using a water sampler (eg, bucket). 

Annotated annotation!
// water has to be an entity because many of the other observations will need it. 
// some of the measurements are straightforward. scientific domains directly measure 
// some characteristics of water, using the same name, although the protocol may vary. 
// tip: if a measurement has the same name as its
// characteristic then the entity will be the 'water'. So these are generally intuitive

// you took measurements in a sample. It might be a physical sample (like a bottle) or 
// an abstract sample (e.g., the area the instrument can sample). Even if the lat-log 
// (station name) is the same, if you came back at a different time you would be sampling 
// a different parcel. There are 2 samples here, an electronic sample and a bottle sample.

	context: obs4

// you observed the name of the place (or the lat-lon) where you took the sample
// notice that "station" and "time" are arranged from bottom to top by how much they
// vary. Station name varies the least, so is context for time, which varies more. Sample 
// varies more that time, because it's possible to take multiple samples at the same time.
obs4 [E=Station]
  	meas: [C=Name, V=Station1]

// you observed the concentration of something in the water, in this case, the nitrate 
// dissolved "in the water" So now the observation of "water" (obs1) becomes the context 
// for this observation. The measurement is of dissolved nitrate, and its entity is the 
// substance. 
obs5 [E=nitrate]
	measurement: [C=amountOfSubstanceConcentration U=molesPerLiter]
	context: obs1

// same as for nitrate, but a different substance for the entity.
obs6 [E=phosphate]
	measurement: [C=amountOfSubstanceConcentration U=molesPerLiter]
	context: obs1



TO DO
The sample used for context in of water? 
obs5 and obs6 could have a different sample than the one that in obs2, because it is
a bottle sample, and the measurements in obs1 are electronic samples.  But we want to imply 
the same WATER. so is it this? but no observation has obs1a as its context now.
