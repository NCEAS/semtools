Morpho semantic plugin
---------------------------

Plugin generally enables:
----
-creating/editing annotation doc (indirectly when working with EML package)
-saving annotation doc (local/network)
	-independent from EML saving
-structured annotation-based search (returns EML packages)

Annotation steps:
-----
-Invoke the annotation wizard dialog
	1. Data->Annotate current column... (or right-click on data table column, select "Annotate...")
	2. If there are no other existing annotations for this datatable:
		a. Present annotation 'wizard'
	3. If there are existing annotations for the this data table:
		a. Prompt to edit existing or to create a new one, then go to (2a)
	4. For the selected package/table/attribute select the Entity+Characteristic_+Standard classes for the column
		a. Each class entry field allows an expanded ontology browser dialog to pop up in order to assist in finding the appropriate class
	5. 'Ok'
		a. Save annotation locally?
		b. Save to network?
	6. 'Cancel'
		a. Discards the annotation for the attribute
		7. Or do we wait to save when the whole EML datapackage is actually saved?

UI Notes:
-----		
-Annotation dialog shows contextual information (DP/table/attribute)
-Annotation dialog allows user to specify Entity+Characteristic+Standard for the selected column/attribute
	-selected from an ontology tree browser (popup)
-Open dialog may need to show any/all existing annotations for (editing/augmentation purposes):
	-for the EML package
	-for the given data table within said EML package
	
Annotation considerations:
----
-Most commonly, annotations will be 1 per EML datatable but there are other cases:
	-1 annotation: 1 data table (1+ per EML)
	-n annotations: 1 data table 
		-say I have different interpretations of what is being observed or how to classify it
		-say someone else (network) has annotated this already and I want a different annotation for it
-Annotation documents can be edited (revision is incremented, locally/network)
-Annotations can be deleted (locally/network)
-Annotations can be searched 
	-initially locally
	-then extend to network-based search where the annotations and SMS manager is on the Metacat side of things

Ontology considerations:
----
-Ontologies used for annotation and for searching will be "retrieved" from Metacat store
	-only those ontologies registered with the [current] Metacat server will be available for annotation editing
	-annotations will reference:
		 1. OBOE (default)
		 2. OBOE-Units (default)
		 3. 0+ OBOE-Extensions (optionally)
-Ontologies will be available locally in the SMS Ontology Manager for use in the Morpho annotation UI (tree browser)
