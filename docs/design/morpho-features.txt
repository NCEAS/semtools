Morpho semantic plugin
---------------------------
Plugin enables:
-creating/editing annotation doc (indirectly when working with EML package)
-saving annotation doc (local/network)
	-independent from EML saving
-structured (annotation-based) search for EML packages

Annotation steps
-Invoke the annotation wizard dialog
	-Data->Annotate current column...
	-right-click on data table column, select "Annotate column..."
-Dialog shows contextual information (DP/table/attribute)
-Dialog allows user to specify Entity+Characteristic+Standard for the column/attribute
	-selected from an ontology tree browser
-Dialog may also need to show any/all annotations for (editing/augmentation purposes):
	-EML package
	-data table within said EML package
	
Annotation considerations:
-Most commonly, annotations will be 1 per EML datatable but there are some permutations:
	-1 annotation: 1 data table (1+ per EML)
	-n annotations: 1 data table 
		-say I have different interpretations of what is being observed
		-say someone else (network) has annotated this already and I want a different annotation for it
-Annotations can be edited (revision is incremented)
-Annotations can be deleted

-Ontologies used for annotation and for searching will be "retrieved" from Metacat store
	-annotations will reference OBOE and OBOE-Units by default and then 0+ OBOE-Extensions
