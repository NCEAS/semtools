Morpho Plugin
------------
-annotation editor
	-add "virtual" measurements to Observations (promoting metadata to the OBOE model)
	DONE-define Observation/Entity/Characteristic/Standard/Protocol and map to a data column
	DONE-combine Measurements as same Observation
	DONE-split Measurements from same Observation
	DONE-add Context for Observation and define the Relationship between them
	DONE-remove Context for Observation
-annotation editor UI
	-use arrows to indicate Context relationships
	-remove Observation row (duplicates information in Entity row)
	-auto-generate Observation and Measurement labels (observation_1, measurement_2, etc..)
	-add tool tips and helpful labels for annotation table rows ("what's an Entity again?"
	DONE-group and merge cells of the same Observation
-search facility
	-compound search combining AND/OR with basic annotation search
	-options for including subclasses/siblings/superclasses
	-fuzzy term search that enters ontology class labels/descriptions to find formal classes
	-merge search results from normal keyword-based searching with annotation-based searching
	DONE-basic search over Entity/Characteristic/Standard/Protocol
-ontology management
	-load local ontology files (logical->physical mappings)
	-load remote ontologies (URI is both logical and physical)
	-load remote ontologies (logical URI maps to physical URL)
	-load Metacat-managed ontologies
-annotation management
	DONE-save annotation when EML is saved (locally)
	-save annotation when EML is saved (network)
	-define permissions (ACL) for annotations
	-track the "author" of the annotation in the annotation schema
	-allow multiple annotations per EML datatable
-aggregation browser
	-"materialize" the annotation in the OBOE model
	-"sensibly" summarize by Observations: sum, mean, min, max
	-OLAP/datamining-style UI for drilling down and adding facets

SMS library
------------
-architecture decoupled from Metacat
	-Metacat as a service provider that SMS can use for document storage, simple searching
	-Data Manager as another service that SMS can utilize
	-both SMS and DM as consumers of Metacat (ecogrid?) services
-ontology managemenet
	-refine OntologyManager interface - focus on the methods we will actually use (clean-up)
		-subclasses
		-superclasses
		-properties
		-ranges
-manage annotations
	-address potential scaling issues (loading all annotation documents at once is not feasible for large corpus)
	-indexed searching (class->annotation mappings)
	-cache "most used" classes (and the annotations that reference them)
	-ensuring ontologies used/referenced in annotations are managed/manageable by the ontology manager
		-do we need a mapping element for physically resolving ontology URIs referenced in annotations?
-search interface
	-create TermExpanderSearch
		-getClassForFuzzySearchTerm(String term);
		-getExpandedClasses(...) with options like:
			-includeDeepSubclasses
			-includeSiblingClasses
			-includeRelatedClasses
				-part-of
				-has-a
			-includeInferredSubClasses
				-uses reasoner
	-create StructuredAnnotationSearch
		-getDatapackages(...)
			-basic search criteria: 
				-{(entity+characteristic[+standard]) (AND|OR) (entity+characteristic[+standard])...}
				-context (TODO: need clarification on this)
			-similar options as included in term expander (subsumption inference, subclass depth, property relations)	
	
Metacat integration
--------------------
-allow Metacat to store OWL/RDF documents
-allow Metacat to store+search annotation documents
-allow Metacat to search annotation documents
-use SMS api for annotation search or should it be more closesly linked to Metacat storage (see caching/indexing in the SMS API section)
-determine permission policy for ontology/annotation documents
	-ontologies should be public
	-annotations might also be public, but the EML they annotate would determine whether they show in search results
	-annotations could also be controlled:
		-by an eml-access module in the annotation schema. 
		-by the setAccess API in Metacat
		-this would prevent us from needlessly searching restricted annotations
