\label{sec:annotation}

Semantic Annotations describe the observation model contained in a
data object. The Annotation serves as a template for constructing a
fully fleshed OBOE model of the [usually tabular] data. Less formal
descriptions of the data attributes are often included in traditional
metadata formats like EML. while there is some overlap between these
two mechanisms - particularly with respect to measurement standards or
units - semantic concepts applied to each attribute have the benefit
of placing the descriptive burden on the ontology from which the
concepts are drawn. Because the Annotation represents a potentially
subjective perspective on the data, they are stored independently as
XML; the former referencing the latter.

The Annotation structure largely mirrors the core classes in
OBOE. Observations are composed of Measurements of a specific Entity
and are represented by a collection of Characteristics (usually just
one) collected using a defined Protocol and Standard (i.e. unit).
Tablular data object attributes are mapped to a Measurement such that
a collection of attributes usually pertain to the Entity of a shared
Observation (\figref{fig:kelp-mass-model}). These Observtions can
provide context for other Observations such that the structure of the
observational data model and collection paradigm are formally
represented in the Annotation.
