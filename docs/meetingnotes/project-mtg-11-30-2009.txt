Semtools Project Meeting, November 30, 2009
-------------------------------------------

Participants

  * Shawn Bowers
  * Ben Leinfelder
  * Mark Schildhauer
  * Margaret O'Brien


Notes: 

* Mark gave a quick overview of his France trip:

  - Discovered the Plant Ontology (PO) and Traits Ontology (TO). These
    are fairly well established (as part of OBO) and generated a lot
    of enthusiasm by vegetation ecologists. The URLs for these can be
    obtained from here:
    http://www.gramene.org/plant_ontology/ontology_browse.html

  - Not clear how to incorporate these into a non-OBO OWL framework,
    however, we agreed that it would be great to be able to use these
    in annotations

  - There is also some work by Joel Bender on units (measurement
    standards) -- he has a webpage for this (?)

  - Mark suggested getting Huiping to work with this group

  - There still seems to be a lack of ontologies for biological
    taxonomies. Although, there was some excitement at TDWG about
    ontologies.

  - Mark is going to work with a postdoc visitor from France for a few
    months (who is planning on coming to NCEAS).

  - There was agreement that incorporating existing ontologies as much
    as possible should be done as part of the semtools work. It is
    totally clear from a technical point of view how to approach this
    (e.g., especially for the OBO based ontologies)
 
  - Mark and Dave Thau worked together on VoCamp breakout group and
    there may be some additional follow-ups with this work (on a
    document describing the benefits of using ontologies, etc.)


* We discussed the need for semtools to "lead the charge" in
  developing useful demonstrations of how to obtain benefits from
  ontologies

    - We agreed that this should be from an informatics / data manager
      perspective, not a computer science perspective

    - There seems to be a lot more interest in developing domain
      ontologies (based on Mark's interactions at TDWG and VoCamp,
      with TraitNet, etc.)

    - Semtools though is focused on a particular type of
      highly-structured data (many different types of contextualized
      observations) as opposed to relatively flat, "linked data" often
      found in molecular biology and biomedicine (and possibly even in
      presence/absence type) datasets

* Huiping started today!

    - Shawn argued that Huiping should be working on "demonstration"
      projects as part of SONet, and more importantly, working with
      Ben on developing the oboe tools for metacat/morpho.

    - Shawn suggested that she could work on the search
      components/services (extending the code Chad started on in the
      iSEEK demo and implementing this work in the codebase Ben is now
      working on in semtools).

    - Another option would be for her to work on the sensible
      summarization services, which are also one of the envisioned
      "killer apps" for OBOE. Data integration, at least at this
      point, should be a bit further down the road (Shawn's opinion)

    - There was some agreement on her looking at search, but also she
      is supposed to be working on core observation models for sonet


* Discussed the two new mock-ups created by Ben

    - The first contains a single row for observations

    - The second contains an observation/entity-individual matrix and
      context shown vertically

    - We leaned towards the second design

    - The second design seems to also contain more information (i.e.,
      it would allow two different observations of the same entity on
      a single row -- although this probably won't occur that often)

    - Agreed that adding a collapse bar on top of the Entity,
      Characteristic, and Standard section would be useful (which
      would allow the obs/individual matrix to be collapsed)

    - Also agreed that it would be useful to have a series of mockups
      of the second design showing information added incrementally by
      a user (to get a feel for how the design would work and look as
      one edited it)

    - Since all of the mockups we've considered so far contain an
      entity, characteristic, and stardard portion, Ben is going to
      start implementing this.

    - Ben is also going to keep working on the screen shots for the
      remaining portions

    - Discussed and seemed to agree that having the labels on the
      right-hand side is good (especially for really wide tables)
