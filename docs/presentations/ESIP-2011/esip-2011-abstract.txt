Semantic discovery and integration tools for environmental data

Rich semantic information describing the content, structure, and relationships
of environmental data can be used to build effective tools for data discovery
and integration.  We have developed such tools within the Semtools project by
using formal annotations on environmental data to link domain-specific ontology
terms from the Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) to particular facets of
environmental data sets.  This annotation approach allows us to maintain data in
traditional scientific formats (e.g., CSV text, NetCDF) while still establishing
formal semantics for the data.  The annotations can then be used to materialize
a full knowledge model of the data (e.g., an RDF graph compatible with Linked Open
Data [LOD] conventions), which in turn drives discovery and integration tools.
We demonstrate this through extensions to the Metacat data repository system
that can be used for semantic search and semantic data subsetting for
heterogeneous environmental data.
