Illustrate
-----------
1) Metadata versus annotation search -- contrast precision
	Keywords:
		-search for 'nitrogen' (7 matches)
		-search for 'leaf nitrogen' (2 matches)
	Annotation (increased precision):
		-search Measurement='Leaf_Nitrogen_Content' (5 matches)
		-search Measurement='Leaf_Nitrogen_Content' and Entity='Grass' (1 match)
	
2) Term expansion (increased recall):
	-search Measurement='Leaf_Trait' (TBD matches - potentially large)

3) Search context
	-search Observation Entity='FertilizationTreatment' provides context for Observation Entity='Leaf' (2 matches)
	
4) Search showing specific combinations of measures
	-search Measurement='Leaf_Nitrogen_Content' and Measurement='Leaf_Area' and Entity='Leaf' (TBD matches)
