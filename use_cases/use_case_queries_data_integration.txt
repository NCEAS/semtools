Macroalgae on the reef take up dissolved nutrients which are transported 
to the reef from two major sources: coastal streams and the open ocean. In 
nitrogen_transport_schematic.png, these two sources are outlined in yellow.

The data integration task is to calculate the nutrient available from each 
of these sources, for each day. SBC measures the amount of nutrient in each 
of the sources and the rate water is delivered to the reef. The integration 
task should compute the flux of one nutrient (nitrate+nitrite) from each 
source.

use case queries for data integration:
1. calculate the flux of nitrate+nitrite from the mouth of Arroyo Burro Creek.
Flux should be in units of micromolesPerDay
